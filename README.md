Fire accidents are one of the most dangerous and hazardous hazardous activities which occurs without our consciousness.
The statistics of fire hazards occurring over the past decade has shot up because of several external and man-made reasons but even
the nature plays an equal role in it.The Fire detection and aversion is possible in areas with proper infrastructure and impeccable
resources but, it remains a severe challenge in rural neighbourhoods and large Forest covers. Forest Fires in India correspond to
the largest number of fire accidents occurring every year. Hence, to avert the threat of forest fires we intend to introduce a novel
method of fire detection using Fixed wing type unmanned aerial vehicle which uses an First person view camera integrated to
the fuselage and the microprocessor based system uses several pre-processing techniques as well as Computer vision package for
detection of forest fires furthermore, with help of a ground station it will timely alert the officials stationed at the applied area.
